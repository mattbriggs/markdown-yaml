# Integration with VS Code

You can effectively integrate this CLI tool directly into **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to streamline your Markdown-to-YAML workflow. VS Code integration makes running your CLI more convenient and provides quick feedback directly within your editor.

Here's how you can integrate your Python CLI into VS Code:



## ‚úÖ **Integration Method 1: Using VS Code Tasks**

VS Code Tasks let you automate running command-line tools directly from your editor.

### üìå **Step-by-step guide:**

1. **Create a Task (`tasks.json`)**

- Open your project in VS Code.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
- Type and select `Tasks: Configure Task`, then select `Create tasks.json from template`, and then choose `Others`.

Replace the content with:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Convert Markdown to YAML",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["src/main.py", "--input", "${file}", "--validate"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "shared"
      },
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### üöÄ **How to use this Task:**

- Open a Markdown file in VS Code.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (macOS).
- The tool automatically converts your currently open Markdown file into YAML with validation.



## ‚úÖ **Integration Method 2: Using VS Code Terminal**

Run your CLI directly from VS Code's built-in terminal:

1. Open Terminal (`Ctrl+`` or ``Cmd+``).
2. Navigate to your project's root directory.
3. Run your CLI tool:

```bash
python src/main.py --input path/to/markdown.md --validate
```



## ‚úÖ **Integration Method 3: Using VS Code Run/Debug Configuration**

You can run/debug your CLI directly from VS Code‚Äôs Run and Debug pane:

### üìå **Step-by-step guide:**

- Go to Run ‚Üí Add Configuration ‚Üí Python.
- Paste the following into `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Run Markdown-to-YAML",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/main.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "args": ["--input", "${file}", "--validate"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### üöÄ **How to use this Configuration:**

- Open your Markdown file in VS Code.
- Click on the **Run** icon in the Activity Bar.
- Select `Run Markdown-to-YAML` and press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Run).



## ‚úÖ **Integration Method 4: YAML Schema Validation in VS Code**

Integrate YAML schema validation for your YAML outputs directly:

- In your YAML files (generated by your CLI), include a schema reference at the top:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schemas/article.schema.json
```

- Install the VS Code extension:  
  [YAML Language Support by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

This provides schema validation, autocompletion, and linting directly within VS Code.



## ‚úÖ **Benefits of VS Code Integration:**

- Quickly trigger conversions directly within your editing workflow.
- Immediate feedback on YAML validation and errors.
- Enhanced productivity and reduced context-switching.



## üö© **Recommended Setup for Efficiency:**

- Use the **VS Code Tasks** (Integration Method 1) for quick, repeatable actions.
- Leverage **YAML schema validation** for seamless authoring and validation.
- Keep the **Integrated Terminal** handy for flexibility.

This integration significantly streamlines your workflow, providing immediate, intuitive access to your Markdown-to-YAML tool right within your editing environment.
